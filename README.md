# Equity Analysis of Women's Outcome Indicators

## Background
* Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam are currently not on track to meet the 2025 WHA nutrition targets[^1]
* Progress has not only been slow but deeply uneven â€“ significant disparities in MIYCN outcomes between, e.g., rich and poor
* To accelerate progress, interventions are needed which target the most vulnerable groups and the furthest behind
* A&T, with GoI support, aims to develop knowledge products that improve understanding of the drivers of vulnerability and pathways to improved nutrition services and behaviors

## Objectives
* Document the existing (and historical) disparities within key MIYCN outcome indicators across a range of relevant equity stratifiers;
* Determine whether the equity trends observed over time, and any observed improvements/deteriorations, are real;
* Interpret the findings to develop and prioritize equity-centric recommendations that aim to increase access and utilization among vulnerable groups.
